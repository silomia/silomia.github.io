00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Welcome
in your moment of peace.

2
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.000
[Bong]

3
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let your eyelids close,
find a good posture,

4
00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:34.000
with a straight, relaxed back.

5
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.800
Take 10 deep breaths 
inhaling through the nose

6
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:47.000
and exhaling through the mouth,

7
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:52.000
by inflating as much as possible
torso and belly,

8
00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:55.000
slowly and deeply.

9
00:00:57.001 --> 00:01:03.000
[Silence]

10
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Focus on how
your body and your back

11
00:01:57.001 --> 00:02:01.150
are in contact with your
chair or the floor.

12
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.500
Take a moment to discover
how you feel

13
00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:10.500
and all the physical
sensations that arise,

14
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.000
there.

15
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Notice the weight of your body,

16
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:23.150
the position
in which it finds itself.

17
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.000
Just feel the sensations of your
body to the best of your ability

18
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:34.650
without trying to change
whatever it is.

19
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.500
You're just becoming aware
of yourself.

20
00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:43.650
Just the way you are.

21
00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.150
Right here, right now.

22
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.600
Let your shoulders loosen up

23
00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:16.000
while you relax
a little deeper.

24
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.150
Focus on your chest
and your heart.

25
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.450
Observe all sensations
that exist there.

26
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.250
Let all the tension
start to fade away.

27
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.400
Now, your focus is shifting
to your arms and hands.

28
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.150
Feel how your arms
are getting heavier.

29
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.700
Let the heaviness and the heat
invade both of your legs,

30
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.350
from the thighs to
the tips of your feet.

31
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.000
Let go of any thoughts
of what will happen next,

32
00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.900
and give your mind and body
the opportunity to meet here,

33
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.650
right now.

34
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.250
Gently, your mind takes
awareness of your entire body.

35
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Connect now
to your breathing,

36
00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:35.000
with the rhythmic movement
that lifts your chest,

37
00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.900
rising with an in-breath,

38
00:05:37.901 --> 00:05:41.150
lowering with an out-breath.

39
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.500
Notice how that rhythm,
this natural rhythm, happens by itself.

40
00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.600
Let all the tension
fade away

41
00:06:11.601 --> 00:06:16.150
while you relax
a little bit more into your body,

42
00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:19.550
right here, right now.

43
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.000
Shift your awareness
down to your belly,

44
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.400
let it soften and feel here

45
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:51.150
the rise and fall
of your breath.

46
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.900
Finally, expand your consciousness
to your entire body,

47
00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:19.150
from the top of your head
to the soles of your feet.

48
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.150
There you are.

49
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.800
Because we are made
of body and mind,

50
00:07:28.801 --> 00:07:32.550
focus (target and merge) at the
same time on these two entities,

51
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.250
and linger here
as much as possible.

52
00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.750
Understand that there is
nothing to do now.

53
00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:50.450
You're just being yourself.

54
00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.500
You'll soon have a moment
of peace for you.

55
00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:11.150
You will either choose to
relax in silence,

56
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.650
or to meditate while asking
yourself a fundamental question.

57
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:20.400
To do this, silence
your desires and needs, 

58
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.650
dismiss the will of others
and outside influence,

59
00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.300
look and face the truth
as it is,

60
00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:33.800
no worse and no better.

61
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.150
It's in that silence of the mind
that the answer will illuminate itself,

62
00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.400
as a self-evident fact.

63
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400
Anyway, remember this:

64
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:52.000
if you realize
that you have other thoughts,

65
00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.150
don't blame yourself.

66
00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.650
Let them pass as
clouds in the sky, 

67
00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.150
don't judge them,
let them go,

68
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:08.150
and bring your attention back
both to your living body

69
00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:12.650
and the peaceful silence
of your mind.

70
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.150
There you are.

71
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.750
Alive and present.

72
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500
[Silence]

73
00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.400
[Bong]
10 minutes

74
00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.400
[Bong] [Bong]

75
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.400
[Bong] [Bong] [Bong]
30 minutes - End of session.
